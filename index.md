## What You Will Learn:

- How to create a PhoneGap project using the PhoneGap Desktop App.

- How to test a PhoneGap project using the PhoneGap Developer App on your mobile device.

- How to use different data storage strategies.

- How to build an application using a single-page architecture and HTML templates.

- How to handle specific mobile challenges such as touch events, scrolling, styling, page transitions, etc.

- How to use several PhoneGap APIs via plugins.


## Requirements

- To complete this workshop, all you need is a code editor, a modern browser, and a connection to the Internet.

- A working knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is assumed, but you don't need to be a JavaScript guru.

>A mobile device or a Mobile SDK is **not** a requirement for this tutorial. You will able to test your application in the browser or with the PhoneGap Developer App with some limitations. If you want the full support of the native APIs then you will need the mobile SDK for that platform (iOS SDK, Android SDK, etc.) installed on your system.
